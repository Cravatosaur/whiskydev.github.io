        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you like Whisky? Do you like meeting new people? Do you like the possibility of learning something new? Then we should talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our events, we hope that you will be able to walk away knowing a little bit more about whisky, what you like, what you don&amp;rsquo;t, and maybe even pick up on a favourite new distillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wanted it to be more than just whisky. Sure we wanted it to be a comfortable environment, where you can learn about whisky, but we also 
want it to be a comfortable environment where you meet other programmers from around town, possibly learn what else is being worked on in Victoria, 
and pick up on some cool new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this appeals to you, we hope you&amp;rsquo;ll get on board, and we&amp;rsquo;ll let you know when it&amp;rsquo;s ready. The easiest way to keep up with what&amp;rsquo;s coming next, follow us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/whiskydev&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; 
or &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/whiskydev&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. But please, help us spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;
