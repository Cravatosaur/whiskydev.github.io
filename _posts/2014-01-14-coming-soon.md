Do you like Whisky? Do you like meeting new people? Do you like the possibility of learning something new? Then we should talk.

At our events, we hope that you will be able to walk away knowing a little bit more about whisky, what you like, what you don't, and maybe even pick up on a favourite new distillery.

We also wanted it to be more than just whisky. Sure we wanted it to be a comfortable environment, where you can learn about whisky, but we also 
want it to be a comfortable environment where you meet other programmers from around town, possibly learn what else is being worked on in Victoria, 
and pick up on some cool new technologies.

If this appeals to you, we hope you'll get on board, and we'll let you know when it's ready. The easiest way to keep up with what's coming next, follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/whiskydev) 
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/whiskydev). But please, help us spread the word.
